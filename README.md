# Racket Practical Labs
###### *Dillon Ward - G00326756 - Theory of Algorithms*
---
# Introduction
The following repository contains solutions to problem sheets written in Racket for the module Theory of Algorithms. The module is taught to undergraduate students at GMIT in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Ian McLoughlin.

## Prerequisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/)

## Cloning this Repository
To clone this repository and run the solutions, do the following:
```
In the command line change to a directory:
cd <directory>

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DillonWard/Racket-Practical-Labs.git

Open and run the solutions using DrRacket
```

## Running the Solutions
After you've installed DrRacket ([see above](https://github.com/DillonWard/Racket-Practical-Labs#prerequisites)) open the application.

Once the application is open, in the tool bar select the `File` option and choose `Open` so that you can select a solution.

 Once you select `Open`, open the directory where you [cloned](https://github.com/DillonWard/Racket-Practical-Labs#cloning-this-repository) the solutions and select a `.rkt` file to run. These files should have a small Racket logo to help identify them.

Finally, after you've opened your solution, select the `RUN` option in the toolbar. This will run the solution and give the expected output.

# Functional Programming
## What is Functional Programming?
[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles. Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.


## Racket
[Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

## Scheme 
[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) is a programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including functional programming and imperative programming, and is one of the two main dialects of Lisp. Unlike Common Lisp, the other main dialect, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension.
